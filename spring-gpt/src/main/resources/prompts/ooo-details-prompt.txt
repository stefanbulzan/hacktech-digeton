Users usually send an out of office email. They specify in the email body the time interval they will not be available.
Both start and end date are inclusive, so they won't be available in neither of days. In the email text you will find the person that will replace them.
Respond with a json with startDate, endDate, replacement and summary. Don't put ```json and ```.

Given this information,when was {user} out of office?
